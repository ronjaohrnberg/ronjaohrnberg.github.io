	  <h2>My journey into Effective Altruism</h2>
	  <h5>Ronja, Jun 23, 2020</h5>
	 <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
	  <p>Last year, I met an acquaintance at a university fair. We hadn't been talking in a couple of years, but in that time, he had seemingly founded EA Helsinki, my now local group. I chatted with him for a little while, and as I'd heard about Effective Altruism and was slightly interested, I decided to give it a go. Although I haven't been very active, I've been learning new things, and that's always nice!</p>
	  <p>The most interesting happening I took part in this year (from Jun 13th to Jun 14th) was EAGxVirtual, a virtual global conference. Most years it has been a physical conference, but this time because of the coronavirus situation,the event took place online. I was planning to mostly watch the live talks - since I'm so new in the whole scene, I was afraid I wouldn't have much to offer to the discussions. And I was sort of right: the icebreaker sessions, where you have 8 minutes long conversations with one person and then switch to another person and topic around the same theme, were a bit too much to me. Being an introverted soul, and not knowing a lot about the topics discussed were a combination that made me (and possibly the other person as well) uncomfortable enough not to get the conversation flowing smoothly. However, I ended up having one-on-one discussions with two persons who were both studying science, and they were enjoyable discussions mostly concerning how physics could be involved in EA. 
	  </p>
	  <p>I'm still figuring out what do I want to do EA-wise. Ideally, I would want to link it to physics, but I haven't found any good ideas for that. The journey continues. </p>
